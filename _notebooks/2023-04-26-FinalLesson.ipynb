    "## Fetching\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Basics\n",
    "- Fetching means getting data from somewhere else, like a website or database.\n",
    "\n",
    "JavaScript is a programming language that can be used to fetch data from a website or database.\n",
    "\n",
    "- When you fetch data with JavaScript, you first need to tell it where to get the data from. This is called the URL.\n",
    "- Once you know the URL, you can use JavaScript to go and get the data from that URL.\n",
    "- When the data comes back, it's usually in a format like text or JSON. This means that you might need to do some additional work to turn the data into something that your website or application can use.\n",
    "- Once you have the data, you can use JavaScript to display it on your website or application. You can put it in a table, show it on a map, or do anything else you can think of.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](images/frontback.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "### About Fetching\n",
    "#### Method\n",
    "The fetching methods are in line with the CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete), and list as follows:\n",
    "- \"GET\": Probably the most common method you would use, which is in line with \"read\". It essentially \"gets\" the information from the API and brings it to the frontend where you are able to display it and read it.\n",
    "- \"POST\": Lines up with \"create\" and adds a resource to the API. You will probably mostly be using this with your own API or if a website adds your input to an API.\n",
    "- \"PUT\" and \"PATCH\": Essentially the \"update\" for API. Use \"PUT\" if you want to change the whole resource, or \"PATCH\" if you want to change just one part of a resource.\n",
    "- \"DELETE\": Exactly how it sounds, deletes a resource from the API\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Popcorn Hacks:\n",
    "- What method should I use if I want to display some of the data stored in the backend?\n",
    "GET\n",
    "- What method would I use if something in the data is misspelled and I want to fix it real quick?\n",
    "PATCH\n",
    "- What method should I use if I want to add a new entry to the data?\n",
    "POST\n",
    "\n",
    "### Filtering Data\n",
    "- If we want to display API data, we are going to have to filter what we want to display for multiple reasons\n",
    "    - These include making sure that the user only sees information they need to see, and not anything else\n",
    "    - Also we need to present the information in a readable format instead of just seeing the raw data"

Mix all together. Form into six 1/2lb patties with burger press. Important to use a press as it creates needed density in the meat and will retain much more juice than were the patties hand formed. Using index finger, make hole in center of each burger patty. Make sure hole is similar size on other side. The hole will insure even cooking throughout the patty. Put in fridge for an hour or more. Preheat both sides of grill on high with wood on one side. Personal wood preference for these is: Pecan. Also good with many other woods, but Pecan seems to blend very well with these seasonings. When wood starts to smoke, turn that side to low, and turn off other side. Put burgers on off side of grill. Turn patties over when they release from grill..maybe 10-15 mins. Remove from grill when they look greasy (juicy) all over the tops. They will be medium well done (no pink) but squirting juice when you bite into them. Meat will be gorgeous...red cast on the outside from the smoke, like an allover exterior smoke ring . For slightly pink interior, remove when starting to show juice on outside. Cover tray of burgers with foil and let set for at least 5 minutes before serving. Know they're just burgers, but folks do rave about them. This recipe started out as Willingham's Holy Burgers. Worked with it, changed the weight, altered the ingredients, etc. Hope you like them...\"}, {'title': 'Honey-Mustard Burgers', 'ingredients': '1 lb Ground beef; 80% lean|3 tb Dijon-style mustard|2 tb Honey|1 tb Oregano leaves; minced -or-|1 ts Dried oregano; divided|1/4 c Diced onion|1/4 ts Black pepper; coarsely ground|4 Leaf lettuce leaves|4 Crusty rolls; split|4 Onion slices; separated into rings', 'instructions': 'Combine mustard, honey and 1 teaspoon oregano; reserve.
